# Python for Scientific Computing

This repository contains my practice and reference code for core Python concepts used in scientific and engineering workflows. It covers fundamental programming constructs as well as commonly used features that support data processing, automation, and reusable code design.

The goal of this repository is to strengthen Python basics that are essential before moving to advanced areas such as data science, machine learning, and scientific computing.

## Topics Covered

The repository includes examples and scripts covering:

- Python basics: variables, data types, operators, and type casting  
- Control flow: `if-else`, `for` loops, `while` loops, ternary operators  
- Data structures: lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries, queues  
- String operations and list/dictionary comprehensions  
- Functions and reusability  
- Object-Oriented Programming:
  - Classes and objects  
  - Class methods  
  - Inheritance  
- Advanced Python concepts:
  - Generators  
  - Decorators  
- Basic file I/O operations

## Scientific Computing Context

These concepts are demonstrated with the perspective of scientific and engineering use cases, such as:

- Writing reusable and readable code
- Working with structured and unstructured data
- Preparing foundations for numerical computation and analysis
- Supporting workflows commonly used in data analysis and ML pipelines
